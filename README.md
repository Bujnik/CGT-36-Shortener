# CodeGymTasks

 CodeGym mini project - level 36 - Shortener
 
This project name is a bit misleading - project was not about shortening strings, but about working with different data structures and introduces to JUnit tests

__________________________________________________________
My takeaways: <br>
-> Getting familiar with Strategy pattern <br>
-> Practice with data structures (Map) <br>
-> Writing a bit code for testing purposes <br>
-> Writing more tests using JUnit

 CodeGym mini project - level 36 - Shortener
 
 URL Shortener
 
It will be similar to Google URL Shortener (https://goo.gl), but we'll extend its functionality and make it console-based.<br>
It will shorten not only links, but also any string. Our Shortener class will return a unique identifier for any string, and vice versa â€” it will return a string based on a previously obtained identifier.<br>
<br>
Two additional requirements for Shortener:<br>
- for two identical strings, the same identifier should be returned;<br>
- it must support as many strings as there are unique long values:<br>
the identifiers will be longs.<br>
